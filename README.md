# dsh-session-settings

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

**Session Settings, MCP Server, and Skill Management plugin for DeepSeek Harness (DSH) Web GUI.**

Configure per-session or global settings directly from the Web GUI with immediate effect:
1. **Subagent Model & Reasoning Effort**: Independently configure provider, model, and reasoning effort for subagents (`subagent`, `subagent_fork`, `workflow`).
2. **Centralized MCP Server Management**: First-class sidebar navigation item for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with 2-stage compatibility probing, automatic protocol downgrade, and tool schema inspection.
3. **Session-Level MCP Tool Control**: Granularly enable/disable MCP servers and specific tools per session or follow global defaults.
4. **Session-Level Skill Management & Control**: Independently enable/disable bundled, user, and project skills per session, with automatic dynamic prompt catalog filtering and execution enforcement.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Do I need to restart `dsh web` after updating session settings or disabling tools/skills?
**A**: No. The host plugin intercepts requests dynamically at runtime and manages tool/skill policies on demand. As soon as you save settings in the Web GUI, they take effect on the very next request.

### Q2: How do I uninstall or remove the plugin?
**A**: Remove it anytime using the DSH CLI:
```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove @local/dsh-session-settings
```
